# Hands on ML book project
# This repository will have all the projects from the book I have been learning from, Hands on ML.
# The housing project code has three models linear decision trees and random forests(which is the final model).
# There have been error detection, cross validation and grid search for the best hyperparameters in this model. When you are using a grid search or a random search, then you are tuning the hyperparameters of the model or order to discover the parameters of the model that result in the most skillful predictions.
# This was a good project I learned many new things.
