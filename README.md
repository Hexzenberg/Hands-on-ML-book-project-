# Hands on ML book project
#This repository will have all the projects from the book I have been learning from, Hands on ML.
#The housing project code has three models linear decision trees and random forests(which is the final model).
#There have been error detection, cross validation and grid search for the best hyperparameters in this model.
#This was a good project I learned many new things.
